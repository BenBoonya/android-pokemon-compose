# Android Pokemon Compose

This repository is a simple app that make request to Â https://pokeapi.co and display them in the paginated lists.
It demonstrates using Jetpack compose the following **Jetpack libraries**
1. Android Jetpack viewmodel
2. Livedata 
3. Navigation component
4. Paging library 3 
5. Hilt dependency injection

This app use MVVM with Clean Architecture along with coroutine.
Using these libraries together does help reduce a lot of boiler plate code in my opinion.

## Here are the screenshots.
